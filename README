# Thumber.php

Thumber is a lightweight and easy to use thumbnail image creation tool written in PHP.

## Installation

Make sure there is a 'thumbs' directory on your server, and that it has the proper permissions (chmod 777 thumbs).

## Usage examples

In your HTML code, you can ask Thumber to generate an image at the appropriate size and it will return the URL of that image.

<img src="thumber.php?img=images/myphoto.jpg&w=540">

This will generate a athumbnail at the appropriate size, and store it in the /thumbs folder.
